# Project Name: DocMate [Live Link](https://doc-mate-two.vercel.app)


## Short Description of DocMate
**DocMate** is a cutting-edge healthcare web application that combines the power of Next.js and AI technologies to deliver a seamless and intelligent healthcare experience. Built using modern tools like Next.js, Mongoose, NextAuth, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, and more, DocMate is designed to serve three types of users: patients, doctors, and admins‚Äîeach with their own unique roles and capabilities.

Patients can easily browse a comprehensive list of verified doctors and book appointments with just a few clicks. They also have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view their appointment history, reports, and status updates. Users interested in becoming doctors can fill out a dedicated request form to apply for a doctor role.

Doctors, once approved, gain access to their own dashboard where they can view incoming appointment requests, accept or reject them, and manage their list of patients.

Admins have full control over the system. They can view and manage all doctors and patients, approve or remove doctor accounts, and ensure the overall health of the platform.

DocMate aims to simplify and digitize the healthcare appointment process while offering a structured, role-based system to ensure secure, efficient, and user-friendly interactions between patients and healthcare providers.


## Challenges Faced During DocMate Development:  
While developing **DocMate**, our four-member team faced several challenges. Implementing NextAuth with email-password authentication was initially tricky, as we had to deeply understand its flow and configuration. Mongoose was also new to us, making backend development quite challenging, especially when structuring models and handling data operations. Managing role-based access for patients, doctors, and admins required careful planning and testing. We also faced issues with secure routing and maintaining user sessions. Despite these hurdles, we worked together, researched extensively, debugged patiently, and successfully overcame all obstacles to complete the project smoothly and effectively.
